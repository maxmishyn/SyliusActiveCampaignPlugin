# Webgriffe Sylius ActiveCampaign plugin

## What does this plugin do?

The _SyliusActiveCampaignPlugin_ takes care of creating and updating contacts, connections, orders, and abandoned carts on
_ActiveCampaign_.

## Who is this plugin for?

**Everyone**! This plugin works for those who have never used _ActiveCampaign_ before and also for those who already use
_ActiveCampaign_ and want to integrate it with _Sylius_.

## How can I install the plugin on my Sylius store?

Please, check the documentation at the [Installation](installation.html) step.

## Is this plugin conformed to privacy?

_This plugin does not check if the customers have given their consent for marketing purposes_. Why? Simply because Sylius
does not do it :). The framework (and the plugins so) should be very flexible to be used all over the world. It couldn't
be possible to provide a solution for everyone, so, _the responsibility to choose which customers, orders, and
connections to export to ActiveCampaign is yours_. **Webgriffe does not take any responsibility for incorrect use of this
integration and for not respecting the wishes of users on their eCommerce / website**. At the same time, this plugin was
designed with these issues in mind and is therefore easily customizable.

## Where do I start?

First, we recommend that you read the entire documentation. Then you could start to
install the plugin and use the basic features it gives such as the abandoned cart. You could also think to suggest some
new features that this integration could add. So, let's start! ðŸš€
